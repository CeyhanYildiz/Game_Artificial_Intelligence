# Game Artificial Intelligence: Maze AI Project

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Game Artificial Intelligence repository! This project is focused on developing an advanced Maze AI using C++.

## Objectives
- **Maze Generation**: Create a complex maze structure.
- **AI Development**: Develop an intelligent AI to navigate through the maze.

## Technologies
- **Language**: C++
- **Maze Generator**: The Binary Tree Algorithm
- **AI Techniques**: UNKNOWN

## Development Plan
- **Phase 1**: Design and implement the maze structure.
- **Phase 2**: Develop the AI algorithm to solve the maze.
- **Phase 3**: Optimize and test the AI for various maze complexities.

## Contributing
Contributions to the project are welcome. Please refer to the contribution guidelines for more information.
